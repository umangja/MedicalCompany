* Client also requires to sort partner by the total amount of medicine they purchased so that gift can be distributed by month end.
* Client also want to get notification whenever some medicine becomes expired so that he can throw that medicine out of stock. Every morning expired medicines will be thrown out so corresponding changes must take place accordingly in the database. Client only sells complete packets of medicines to the stops. And he receives a carton from the company consisting of many packets. So each packet has the same expiration date. Also due to financial issues Client only buys new inventory when stock is out means he do not order when stock of a particular medicine goes below a limit instead he only order when stock becomes zero.

So we need not make it look good to attract audience. But it should be completely lag free and smooth experience. It should include very basic stuff like medicines required and their quantity. 
* A chat portal, where the user enters some of their details and puts their queries or concerns in the message dialog box.  The client can check for any such pending queries on their account and answer to them. Client should get a notification whenever such a query appear so that he can answer it ASAP.
* Client also wants that on the website itself some lucky draw kind of competition between top 5 partners for a prize every month.
